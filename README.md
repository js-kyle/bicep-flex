# Bicep Flex ðŸ’ª

This is an example project which deploys infrastucture using Azure Bicep.

This is a simple starter project which will deploy the following resources to Azure:

- Azure API Gateway (Consumption tier)

  This publishes the API to the internet and upholds the API contract defined in `bicep-flex/orders-openapi.yaml`.

- Azure CosmosDB (MongoDB API)

  This is a minimal SKU Cosmos which is used to demonstrate functionality within the Orders API

- Azure Function (Consumption tier)

  A basic JavaScript Azure Function which connects to the Azure CosmosDB data source for CRUD operations

- Azure Blob Storage

  A blob storage account, required as a dependency of Azure Functions.
